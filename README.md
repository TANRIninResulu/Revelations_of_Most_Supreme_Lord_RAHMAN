5:67 O You Messenger! DELIVER WHAT IS REVEALED TO YOU FROM YOUR OWNER - until you do, you have not delivered HIS MESSAGE - and GOD WILL PROTECT you from the people. GOD does not guide the disbelieving people. 
 
5:68 Say, "O people of THE SCRIPTURE, you have no basis until you uphold THE TORAH, and the Gospel, and WHAT IS SENT DOWN TO YOU HEREIN FROM YOUR OWNER." For sure, THESE REVELATIONS FROM YOUR OWNER will cause many of them to plunge deeper into transgression and disbelief. Therefore, do not feel sorry for the disbelieving people. 
 
5:69 Surely, those who believe, those who are Jewish, the converts, and the Christians; any of them who (1) believe in GOD and (2) believe in THE LAST DAY, and (3) LEAD A RIGTEOUS LIFE, have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve. 
 
5:70 We have taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we sent to them Messengers. Whenever a Messenger went to them with anything they disliked, some of them they rejected, and some they killed. 
 
5:71 They thought that they would not be tested, so they turned blind and deaf, then GOD REDEEMED them, but then many of them turned blind and deaf again. GOD IS SEER OF EVERYTHING they do.
